"""
GPU driver for C kernels

There should be a single GPU environment running on the system.  This
environment is constructed on the first call to :func:`env`, and the
same environment is returned on each call.

After retrieving the environment, the next step is to create the kernel.
This is done with a call to :meth:`GpuEnvironment.make_kernel`, which
returns the type of data used by the kernel.

Next a :class:`GpuData` object should be created with the correct kind
of data.  This data object can be used by multiple kernels, for example,
if the target model is a weighted sum of multiple kernels.  The data
should include any extra evaluation points required to compute the proper
data smearing.  This need not match the square grid for 2D data if there
is an index saying which q points are active.

Together the GpuData, the program, and a device form a :class:`GpuKernel`.
This kernel is used during fitting, receiving new sets of parameters and
evaluating them.  The output value is stored in an output buffer on the
devices, where it can be combined with other structure factors and form
factors and have instrumental resolution effects applied.

In order to use OpenCL for your models, you will need OpenCL drivers for
your machine.  These should be available from your graphics card vendor.
Intel provides OpenCL drivers for CPUs as well as their integrated HD
graphics chipsets.  AMD also provides drivers for Intel CPUs, but as of
this writing the performance is lacking compared to the Intel drivers.
NVidia combines drivers for CUDA and OpenCL in one package.  The result
is a bit messy if you have multiple drivers installed.  You can see which
drivers are available by starting python and running:

    import pyopencl as cl
    cl.create_some_context(interactive=True)

Once you have done that, it will show the available drivers which you
can select.  It will then tell you that you can use these drivers
automatically by setting the PYOPENCL_CTX environment variable.

Some graphics cards have multiple devices on the same card.  You cannot
yet use both of them concurrently to evaluate models, but you can run
the program twice using a different device for each session.

OpenCL kernels are compiled when needed by the device driver.  Some
drivers produce compiler output even when there is no error.  You
can see the output by setting PYOPENCL_COMPILER_OUTPUT=1.  It should be
harmless, albeit annoying.
