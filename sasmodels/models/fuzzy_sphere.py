Definition
----------

The scattering intensity *I(q)* is calculated as:

.. math::
    I(q) = \frac{scale}{V}(\Delta \rho)^2 A^2(q) S(q) +\text{background}


where the amplitude *A(q)* is given as the typical sphere scattering convoluted
with a Gaussian to get a gradual drop-off in the scattering length density:

.. math::

    A(q) = \frac{3\left[\sin(qR) - qR \cos(qR)\right]}{(qR)^3}
           \exp\left(\frac{-(\sigma_{fuzzy}q)^2}{2}\right)

Here *|A(q)|*:sup:`2`\  is the form factor, *P(q)*. The scale is equivalent to the
volume fraction of spheres, each of volume, *V*\. Contrast (|drho|) is the
difference of scattering length densities of the sphere and the surrounding
solvent.

Poly-dispersion in radius and in fuzziness is provided for, though the fuzziness
must be kept much smaller than the sphere radius for meaningful results.



From the reference:

  The "fuzziness" of the interface is defined by the parameter
  |sigma| :sub:`fuzzy`\ . The particle radius *R* represents the radius of the
  particle where the scattering length density profile decreased to 1/2 of the
  core density. The |sigma| :sub:`fuzzy`\ is the width of the smeared particle
  surface; i.e., the standard deviation from the average height of the fuzzy
  interface. The inner regions of the microgel that display a higher density
  are described by the radial box profile extending to a radius of
  approximately *Rbox* ~ *R* - 2\ |sigma|\ . The profile approaches zero as
  *Rsans* ~ *R* + 2\ |sigma|\ .

For 2D data: The 2D scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the *q* vector is defined as

.. math::

    q = \sqrt{{q_x}^2 + {q_y}^2}
