The model calculates an empirical functional form for SAS data characterized
by broad_peak

Definition:
-----------
Many SANS spectra are characterized by a broad peak even though they are
from amorphous soft materials.
The d-spacing corresponding to the broad peak is a characteristic distance
between the scattering inhomogeneities (such as in lamellar, cylindrical,
or spherical morphologies or for bicontinuous structures).
The following simple functional form reproduces the broad peak feature:

.. math:: I(q) = \frac{I_0}{({1 + (|q - q_0|\xi)^m})}^p

Here the peak position is related to the d-spacing as $q0 = 2Ï€/d$.
Soft systems that show a SANS peak include copolymers, polyelectrolytes,
multiphase systems, layered structures, etc.

..note::
    For $q0 = 0$, $m = 2$ and $p = 1$ one gets the Ornstein-Zernike model.
    For $q0 = 0$, $m = 2$ and $p = 2$ The Broad-Peak model is identical to the
    Debye-Anderson-Brumberger model.

For 2D data the scattering intensity is calculated in the same way as 1D,
where the $q$ vector is defined as

.. math:: q = \sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2}
