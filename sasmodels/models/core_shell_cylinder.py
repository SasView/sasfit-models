Definition
----------

The output of the 2D scattering intensity function for oriented core-shell
cylinders is given by (Kline, 2006)

.. math::

    I(q,\alpha) = \frac{\text{scale}}{V_s} F^2(q) + \text{background}

where

.. math::

    F(q) = &\ (\rho_c - \rho_s) V_c
           \frac{\sin \left( q \tfrac12 L\cos\alpha \right)}
                {q \tfrac12 L\cos\alpha}
           \frac{2 J_1 \left( qR\sin\alpha \right)}
                {qR\sin\alpha} \\
         &\ + (\rho_s - \rho_\text{solv}) V_s
           \frac{\sin \left( q \left(\tfrac12 L+T\right) \cos\alpha \right)}
                {q \left(\tfrac12 L +T \right) \cos\alpha}
           \frac{ 2 J_1 \left( q(R+T)\sin\alpha \right)}
                {q(R+T)\sin\alpha}

and

.. math::

    V_s = \pi (R + T)^2 (L + 2T)

and $\alpha$ is the angle between the axis of the cylinder and $\vec q$,
$V_s$ is the volume of the outer shell (i.e. the total volume, including
the shell), $V_c$ is the volume of the core, $L$ is the length of the core,
$R$ is the radius of the core, $T$ is the thickness of the shell, $\rho_c$
is the scattering length density of the core, $\rho_s$ is the scattering
length density of the shell, $\rho_\text{solv}$ is the scattering length
density of the solvent, and *background* is the background level.  The outer
radius of the shell is given by $R+T$ and the total length of the outer
shell is given by $L+2T$. $J1$ is the first order Bessel function.

.. _core-shell-cylinder-geometry:

.. figure:: img/core_shell_cylinder_geometry.jpg

    Core shell cylinder schematic.

To provide easy access to the orientation of the core-shell cylinder, we
define the axis of the cylinder using two angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. 
(see :ref:`cylinder model <cylinder-angle-definition>`)

NB: The 2nd virial coefficient of the cylinder is calculated based on
the radius and 2 length values, and used as the effective radius for
$S(q)$ when $P(q) \cdot S(q)$ is applied.

The $\theta$ and $\phi$ parameters are not used for the 1D output.

Validation
----------

Validation of our code was done by comparing the output of the 1D model to
the output of the software provided by the NIST (Kline, 2006).

Averaging over a distribution of orientation is done by evaluating the
equation above. Since we have no other software to compare the
implementation of the intensity for fully oriented cylinders, we
compared the result of averaging our 2D output using a uniform
distribution $p(\theta,\phi) = 1.0$.
